# Optimizing with Cython (optional)
## Introduction 
Cython can be used to speed up code, make use of C's memory management, and to access external C libraries.
Currently, Kairos only uses Cython to generate C code to modestly improve it's speed. 
Therefore, using Cython is completely optional until such time that Kairos uses external C libraries, C memory management, or other C dependencies.

A cohesive write up on Cython can be found [here](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3250299/what-is-cython-python-at-the-speed-of-c.html).
For further information, please visit the [Cython website](https://cython.org/).

## Prerequisites
You will need a C compiler.
If you are using Linux or macOS, you are in luck. You should already have a C compiler.

For Windows, download and install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019 from the [Microsoft downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) page. 
From that page scroll down to _All Downloads -> Tools for Visual Studio 2019_ and download _[Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)_. 

## Steps
1. [File preparation](#python-file-preparation)
2. [Generate C code](#generate-c-code)
3. [Install](#install-dependencies)
4. [Clean up](#clean-up)

If you are on Windows you can use [build_public.bat](build_public.bat) to automate the aforementioned steps. 

## Python file preparation
For each python file you wish to generate C for, do the following:
* Add it to setup.py under extension modules (both for generation and linking), e.g. `Extension('tv.tv', ['tv//tv.py'], **ext_options)` and `Extension('tv.tv', ['tv//tv.pyd'], **ext_options)`
* Add it to process.bat so that the output file is properly named (as per setup.py), in the following format: `ren <basename>.cp37-win32.pyd <basename>.pyd`, for example: `ren tv.cp37-win32.pyd tv.pyd`
* If you want to obfuscate the source code, add it to process.bat again in the following format: `del <basename>.py`, for example: `del tv.py`

## Generate C code
To generate the C code do the following:
1. Rename setup.py to _setup.py
2. Rename cython.py to setup.py
3. Run: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
4. Rename setup.py to cython.py
5. Rename _setup.py to setup.py

## Install dependencies
Install dependencies: 

`python setup.py install`

## Clean up
Process the generated files by running (Windows CMD): `process.bat`

The script will do the following:
* Rename \<basename>.cp37-win32.pyd files to \<basename>.pyd
* Remove source files
* Remove cython.py
* Remove unnecessary files
